In this study, we investigated how well the DenseNet architectureâ€”a cutting-edge A 
convolutional neural network could identify eye diseases using publicly available fundus 
images from Kaggle. The selected dataset includes images representing three major eye conditions 
along with healthy retinal photographs. We carefully preprocessed the images and 
subsequently trained the DenseNet models employing transfer learning techniques. The results 
were encouraging: our model attained a peak validation accuracy of 93.18%, indicating that it 
could reliably distinguish between different conditions across a diverse range of patient 
samples.
